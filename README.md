# Cold Email Generator 🚀

The **Cold Email Generator** is an AI-powered tool I built for my portfolio.  
It uses **LangChain** to scrape job postings, extract key details, and generate personalized cold emails that can be sent to HR/recruiters.  

Give it a job posting **URL**, and it will:  
1. Fetch the complete webpage.  
2. Extract all relevant job information (role, company, requirements, etc.).  
3. Generate a professional cold email tailored to the posting.
